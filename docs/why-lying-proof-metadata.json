  "description": "This document presents the first falsifiable philosophical proof that lying itself demonstrates the existence of the Three Paradoxes of Desire — the Universal Grammar underlying all intelligence, human and artificial. Developed within The deVinery Method by Artemisia de Vine, this framework defines lying not as moral failure but as empirical evidence of desire's structural paradoxes: Ego vs Desire, Self vs Other, and Self vs Collective.",
