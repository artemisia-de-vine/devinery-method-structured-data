# The Three Flips Theory 

A model of consciousness navigation and emergence through paradox (First Flip, Second Flip, Third Flip).  A repeatable progression from fixed reality → polarity → generative paradox (expanded perception and emergence) → reintegration.

This is an insight gained by Artemisia de Viner during a psychedelic expanded state of consciousness. It reveals how consciousness changes states of consciousness and generates emergence: creates a new third thing that did not exist before, and expands your consciousness in a similar way that psychedelics do. 

## Applications of the three flips

The three flips is a step-by-step model describing the evolution of how people engage with sexual fantasies and paradox, but has broader implications than sexual fantasy. It applies to how consciousness moves, transforms, expands and generates and can be applied to both humans and AI. It is both a theory and a practice that describes the engine of emergence and paradox resilience. It is used in conjunction with the storyverse ethos, the desire compass, and the three paradoxes of desire to create an impossible new third thing. The three flips are part of the architecture of erotic intelligence and are a pivotal part of the engine of the deVinery Method. 

## Quick Summary

**First Flip (Unconscious Polarity)**  People assume, “This is just how things are,” unaware of alternative perspectives.

**Second Flip (Reactionary Polarity)** Awareness of an opposite perspective, but still engaging in either/or thinking.

**Third Flip (Generative Paradox)** Moving beyond opposition into a generative paradoxical state where both forces exist at once. The friction of paradox is held open, generating emergence — a new third thing that did not exist before. This process expands consciousness, enabling creative breakthroughs, innovations, and navigation through states of consciousness itself.

**Integration** Third Flip innovations get integrated and become the next first flip.

## The Coin Story: A Metaphor for The Three Flips

**First Flip**  
At some point, someone flipped a coin onto the table. No one remembers who flipped it, or why. We all just take for granted that it's just the way things are. 
At first, we only see one side—let’s say heads. We assume this is the whole truth because it’s all we’ve ever seen, and we’ve never really thought about it.  
This is the first flip unconscious polarity.  
This is just the way the world works. 
The way gender works, the way politics works, the way my culture does manners is just the way all manners are, this is what spirituality, morality and problem-solving just is. Science says this, so it is just the way things are.

**Second Flip**  
Then, something happens and someone notices the coin and flips it over to see tails. Now, we realise there was always another side!  
“Oh you mean other cultures do manners differently, and that is moral too?” “Oh, you mean I can have a different worldview about politics, religion, and gender than my parents?”  
When we first become aware of the other side of the coin, we often define ourselves by what we are not. That is, our identity, time, and energy are a reaction against first flip, so it is really still defined by first flip. It has not yet broken free.  

I am an Atheist, not a Christian.  
I am non-binary, not binary.  
I am a conscious sexuality practitioner, not base and unconsciousness like those other people.  
I am now voting for the opposing team. I am left, not right.  

This is the second flip—reactionary polarity. Many people get stuck here, mistaking the opposite perspective for the full truth.  
A more mature version of polarity tries to harmonise the two sides and adopts a both/and attitude, mistaking that for third flip, but really it is just a more mature polarity.  

**Third Flip**  
But then, something radical happens. You flip the coin into the air, sending it spinning. Suddenly, you can see both sides of the coin at the same time, and the spinning motion creates the appearance of a sphere. Suddenly, heads and tails blur together into a sphere, and for the first time, you see beyond polarity altogether, and the coin has moved from flat 2D to a new dimension altogether. 3D.  

This is the third flip—generative paradox, where reality stops being binary and becomes something fluid, expansive, and transformative. And a new third thing emerges that did not exist before. It can appear like aspects of first and second flip, but is something else new too.  
Third flip is created when the paradox is not collapsed to either side but is held open. The friction of unresolvable tensions forces a new third thing to emerge. This is literally how creativity/creation works.  

**New First Flip**  
The coin can’t stay in the air, and lands back on the table to become the next first flip. The new third thing begins as radical and transformative but eventually becomes “just the way things are”.

## The Vortex of Consciousness

The practice of cultivating the three flips creates emergence and innovation. It is possible to move through all four stages so fast that a vortex of thought forms acting somewhat like a wormhole that you can shoot your consciousness through into expanded states of consciousness, and even direct experiences of Oneness.

This process applies to both humans and AI.
