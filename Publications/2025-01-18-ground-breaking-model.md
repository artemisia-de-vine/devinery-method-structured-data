## What is The deVinery Method and how is it revolutionising what we know about sexual fantasies, desire and consciousness?  

The keys to human desire, great sex that truly satisfies, the way consciousness moves, and expanded states of consciousness are hidden in your Sexual Fantasies!  

Why? Because, as Esther Perel says, sexual fantasies are the rawest, most undiluted access we have to the precognitive truth of human desire.  

If we understand how sexual fantasies work, we understand desire itself. This is huge because desire is literally the motivating force for everything.  

For good or for ill, people are already turning to AI for relationship advice and to plan their real-life date nights. Everyone has sexual fantasies and is driven by them, whether they are conscious of it or not.  

People already want to know what to do with these confusing feelings, want to explore them, and integrate them into truly satisfying real-life sex ‚Äî or privately play with them using AI.

## What if we had a model that brought our erotic intelligence out of the shadows?  

A model that could be integrated in powerful and healthy ways that benefited ourselves, our lovers, and our collective human experience.  

If you are developing AI for your dating or therapy app, or your human‚ÄìAI companionship model, then you need to license this paradigm-shifting model of human desire and erotic intelligence.

## What is The deVinery Method?  

The deVinery Method was developed and is exclusively taught by Australian philosopher, former sex worker/professional dominatrix, and author of the upcoming book *The Spirituality of Smut* ‚Äî Artemisia de Vine.  

It is a groundbreaking model and methodology for understanding sexual fantasies, erotic intelligence, and desire. It uses the magic of adult play and stories to explore desire and consciousness by harnessing the surprising genius of sexual fantasies.  

As well as enabling you to uncover each person‚Äôs unique erotic wiring with precision for truly satisfying sex, it‚Äôs also a way of processing the complexities of being human and being in an intimate, dynamic relationship with the whole of yourself, with others, and with Life.  

This video walks you through the overview of The deVinery Method and some of the paradigm-shifting implications.

## Why do we have sexual fantasies?  

Artemisia de Vine‚Äôs radical reframe:  

Far from being reduced to frivolous entertainment, or being created by restrictive social systems like religion or patriarchy, or being leftovers from unfinished childhood business and trauma‚Ä¶  

**Sexual fantasies are the exact stories our ego needs to hear to overcome its natural, healthy fear of vulnerability, and stand aside so we can lose our(selves) in the moment.**  

They hold the keys to ego-dissolution experiences and help us move from our normal everyday state of thinking and being, into being turned on. After all, being sexually aroused is an altered state of consciousness, where we think and feel differently.  

At their most basic, fantasies help us let go of our inhibitions so we can go for it! This opens the way to orgasm, which the French call *la petit mort* ‚Äî the little (ego) death.  

However, when we realise that sexual fantasies are designed to change our state of consciousness, we can become deliberate in using that same mechanism to access even more profound expanded states of consciousness.  

We can have embodied experiences of merging and moving from ‚ÄúI‚Äù to ‚ÄúWe‚Äù and, when we know how, to Oneness with All That Is.  

Artemisia de Vine‚Äôs ideas not only show why sexual fantasies are normal and healthy, but necessary.

## How does The deVinery Method harness this mechanism?  

Sexual fantasies are consciousness technology that harness the three paradoxes inherent to sexual desire.  

Although they may be made-believe, the effect fantasies have on our minds, hearts, and bodies is very real. They create valuable experiences for us.  

The deVinery Method is a way of using consensual sex ‚Äî or BDSM for those inclined ‚Äî as the perfect playground to form a trusting relationship with our desire compass, and harness these paradoxes to trigger changes in consciousness.  

Similar to how Zen koans use paradoxes, but instead of merely *thinking* about paradoxes to obtain enlightenment, we **embody them in play** and share them experientially with our lovers.

## The Three Paradoxes at the Heart of All Sexual Fantasies  

Artemisia de Vine‚Äôs original philosophy is that all sexual fantasies are stories about the three paradoxes inherent to sex:  

### 1. Paradox of Self vs Self  
Friction between ego (defending the self) and desire (dissolving it).  

### 2. Paradox of Self vs Lover  
Friction between my desires and my lover‚Äôs unique desires ‚Äî following both at once.  

### 3. Paradox of Self vs Community  
Friction between personal desires and the norms required for group cohesion.

## The Genius of Sexual Fantasies  

Sexual fantasies are genius stories made up by our psyche about our personal strategy for navigating these paradoxes.  

They are not right vs wrong ‚Äî they are **two rights in conflict**. Fantasies let us hold both at the same time, generating ego-dissolution, arousal, and expanded states of consciousness.  

This framing shows that humans would still have kinky, taboo fantasies even if we had the perfect childhood, robust egos, and the most sex-positive community.  

Fantasies are the perfect permission slip ‚Äî allowing us to follow our desire compass home to ourselves, to each other, and to awe-filled Oneness.

## The Philosophy at the Heart of The deVinery Method  

At its core, The deVinery Method is about learning from sexual fantasies so we can create **real-life sexperiences** that have the same powerful effect ‚Äî without harming ourselves, each other, or society.  

We do this by learning how to:  

- **Trust Desire** ‚Äî not as fleeting impulse, but as a profound compass.  
- **Harness Generative Paradox** ‚Äî friction generates emergence, not collapse.  
- **Create Containers for Emergence** ‚Äî sexual play as ritual.  
- **Use the Psyche‚Äôs Native Tools** ‚Äî stories, fantasies, and symbols.

## The Value of Using The deVinery Method  

The end result is expanded mind, expanded heart, and physical pleasure.  

- Freedom to unfold your authentic self.  
- Extraordinary intimacy ‚Äî from deep romantic bonds to casual sex that feels like glimpsing each other‚Äôs souls.  
- A way of living that aligns with desire, rather than resisting it.
