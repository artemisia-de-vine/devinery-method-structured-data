# The deVinery Method — Schema

The **deVinery Method (TdM)** is a proprietary intellectual property framework created by **Artemisia de Vine**.  
It maps how **sexual fantasies function as high-precision consciousness technology**, revealing the paradox structure of desire and enabling transformation through **Third Flip states**.

## Overview

- 📖 Developed since **2010**, actively evolving through research, practice, and cultural work.

- ⚡ Schema published here as part of **IP licensing strategy**, not as open-source software.

## Key Concepts
